## Instructions for setting up the project
The application has been developed using the game engine Unity version 5.4.1f1. Unity can be downloaded for free from https://unity3d.com/.

A Kinect v2 motion sensor is used for user input.

Once you have the project files on your computer, you need to download and import the Unity package for Kinect into the project. You can download the package from [Microsoft's website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect/tools). Look for "Unity Pro packages". The package will work in the free version of Unity too, regardless of the name.
